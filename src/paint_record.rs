// Added by ibis inc. for ibisOffice (2026-09-29): a record of what a window
// paints, for exporting it as vector graphics.

//! What a window painted, in order, as drawing commands rather than pixels:
//! for writing it out as vector graphics (a PDF page). Start recording with
//! [`crate::Window::record_paints`]; each frame starts a new record, and
//! [`crate::Window::take_recorded_paints`] gives the last frame's.
//!
//! Coordinates are in logical pixels from the window's top-left corner.
//! Colors already carry the element's opacity. `clip` is the content mask
//! the command was painted in.
